# Global Fuel Import Analysis

This project was completed as part of ECON 366 (Energy Economics) at the University of Alberta. It uses WITS trade data to generate a global heatmap of fuel import dependency for the year 2022. The analysis focuses on energy security, highlighting geographic vulnerabilities to global price shocks. Data processing was completed in R using tidyverse, with a focus on stylized, interpretable mapping of trade exposure.
