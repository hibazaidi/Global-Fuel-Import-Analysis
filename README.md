This heatmap visualizes global fuel import dependency in 2022, focusing on products classified under HS Code 27 — mineral fuels, oils, and related materials. Globally, developing economies in Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia show significant exposure, reflecting vulnerability to global price shocks. Definitions for HS Code 27 are available here.

The European region tells an urgent story of the severity of fuel dependency among countries like Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia, many of which historically sourced a significant share of their energy from Russia. Before the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Federation was one of the top global fuel exporters. However, the war in 2022 catalyzed a rapid reorientation of Europe’s energy strategy. Countries rushed to diversify supply chains, increase LNG imports, and invest in renewables. The map captures this pre-shift snapshot, making visible the vulnerabilities that fueled Europe’s urgent pivot away from Russian energy, with broad implications for global trade, energy markets, and geopolitical alliances.
